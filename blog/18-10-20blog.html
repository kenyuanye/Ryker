										<h2>Ryker's visit<br />
										To ZigZag Track Titirangi</h2>
										
										<p>Weekend tracking starts again!<br />
										This time we visited the short ZigZag track in Titirangi, west of Auckland.<br />
										It was an easy track and I also made some friends by the waterfront!<br />

								<p>My family loves the west, so we decide to visit another track on the west side of Auckland, near Titirangi town.
									It is a short 30 minutes track, covered by forestes and end at Titirangi beach.

								<span class="image right"><img src="images/pic10.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								It is called ZigZag track for a reason though, the track zigzags down hill until we reach the beach, I think we will have a hard time coming back to the car.
								</p>
								<p>We arrived at the beach to have lunch, then we met a duck couple wanting to play with us.
									They were also fighting other duckies which I found super amusing.

								<span class="image left"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								I had alot of rice and shared my food with the duckies. They were very happy and I think we became friends afterwards.
								
								As I expected, daddy and mummy got very tired when heading back to the car, it was all up hill walk! They had to stop for a break before we end the trip and I enjoy those moments looking at them relax.<br />

								My Weekend is almost over, I am sure my next hike will be more exciting.

								</p>
