										<h2>Ryker's First Hiking<br />
										To Mercer Bay Loop Walk</h2>
										
										<p>First ever hiking ticked off for me on the weekend of 11th.<br />
										We had A short walk to see NZ's beutiful west coastline and learn about NZ history.<br />
										It was also a challenge to sit in the car seat for over an hour, but I did it!

								<p>Mercer Bay loop walk is located on the west coast of Auckland, near Piha.
								A short walk (30-40 mins) lead us to the old Mario settlement, or what remains of it.
								I am super excited just to be out and see the sun, seeing people walking pass and see the ocean for the first time.

								Mum and dad also try to do an exercise to see if I can sit in the car seat longer, preparing for longer trips, which turn out to be successful.
								</p>
								<p>We had a quick lunch break looking out to the cliff, sitting on the grass.
									I am not too interested in looking at the scenery though, rather I'm extremly curious with how grass could taste like, attempted to put it in my mouth a few times without success.

								After a change of diaper and felt of freshness, we make our way to the flatland, where it used to be the Maori settlement back in the days. I can't imagie how people could live in a place like this, where are the playgrounds?
								
								We made our way back in the afternoon, I had so much fun but also very tired, so I quickly fall a sleep in the car before I got back home. What a day!
